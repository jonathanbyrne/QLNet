       with the specific relevant underlying (e.g. bond, stock, commodity, loan/deposit). These functions must be used to set the
       protected member variables underlyingSpotValue_ and underlyingIncome_ within performCalculations() in the derived

       discount future income/dividends/storage-costs etc back to the evaluation date.
